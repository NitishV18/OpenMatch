💖 OpenMatch – The Open Source Dating App

Our goal is to create a feature-rich, ethical dating experience while keeping all code public, modifiable, and self-hostable.

Verified badges and location display for trust and context.

Interest tags for quick compatibility hints.

Profile search & filters (age, distance, interests).

Dark / light mode themes.
